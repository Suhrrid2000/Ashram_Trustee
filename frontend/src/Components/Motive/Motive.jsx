      <p>
        Nurtured by the sacred teachings and spiritual reforms of our revered
        Āchāryas, we have humbly endeavored for the spiritual and social welfare
        of humanity. Indeed, it is our exalted preceptors who are the true
        initiators of this great yajña.
      </p>

      <p>
        The propagation of the holy name of Śrī Bhagavān is our supreme and
        foremost purpose. The eternal message of our Āchāryas is{" "}
        <i>“With the Holy Name on the lips and service in the hands.”</i> Thus,
        with the all-purifying names of the Lord:
      </p>

      <p className="mantra">
        <i>
          Hare Krishna Hare Krishna <br />
          Krishna Krishna Hare Hare <br />
          Hare Rama Hare Rama <br />
          Rama Rama Hare Hare
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        We aspire to engage in works that bring true welfare to society. Guided
        by this ideal, daily worship, thrice-daily prayers, homa, special pūjās,
        the sacred observance of Chāturmāsya, and the offering of food through
        the nitya-annadāna yajña are performed. Alongside, our Sevā Kendra
        organizes free health camps to serve the ailing, and various efforts are
        undertaken to support those in financial need with means of livelihood.
        During the winter, warm clothing is distributed, and at other times,
        garments are lovingly offered to the Lord through His children—the
        people of this world.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is our solemn resolve that in the days to come, we shall remain
        devoted partners in these sanctified endeavors of our Āchāryas, ever
        engaged in the divine service of humanity as the living embodiments of
        God.
